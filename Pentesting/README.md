### ðŸ”¹ System Attacks  
Target the operating system and its core components.  
Examples:  
- Kernel exploits  
- Memory management attacks (buffer overflow, privilege escalation)  
- Attacks on system services (SSH brute force, DoS, rootkits)  

### ðŸ”¹Application Attacks  
Target specific applications, their code, and vulnerabilities.  
Examples:
- SQL Injection  
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)  
- API attacks

## Selected attacks with potential consequences, conducted using selected tools can be found at table below:
> The **bolded** tools will be selected as the primary ones.

| Threat                 | Attack Consequences                                         | Attack Vector                                                       | Selected Tools                         |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1. SQL Injection       | Access to SQL database data. Privilege escalation. Data manipulation. | Vulnerable SQL queries â€“ lack of user input validation.                 | **SQLMap**, Burp Suite                     |
| 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | Session cookie theft. Remote code execution.                 | Injecting malicious JavaScript code into the website content.           | **XSSer**, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP           |
| 3. SSH Bruteforce      | Unauthorized access. Taking control over a remote server.      | Attack targeting the port where the SSH service operates (default 22).  | **Hydra**, Medusa, Metasploit              |
| 4. Port Scanning       | Identifying open ports and available services. A "non-intrusive" reconnaissance attack. | Attack using procedures such as TCP handshake to scan available ports. | **Nmap**                                   |
| 5. DoS (Denial of Service) | Server resource overload. The goal is service unavailability. | Attack utilizes high network traffic volume (e.g., ICMP, UDP).         | **Hping3**, Scapy                          |
| 6. TCP SYN Flooding    | Overloading the server's connection table. Service unavailability. | Exploiting the handshake mechanism in the TCP protocol.                 | **Hping3**, Scapy                          |
